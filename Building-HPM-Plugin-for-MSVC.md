After you've either built your own plugin or downloaded a plugin from the forums, you need to configure your build to include the plugin as a sub project.

There are 2 guides on how to prepare your Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) environment for a new [[HPM]] plugin.

You can choose to follow either one.

## Requirements

You need the following:

#### An IDE to build your server with

[Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - This [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment?oldformat=true) will be used to build your main build solution (your Hercules server), and to include your plugins as new sub projects.

As of December 2018, the IDE version I used for updating this guide uses `Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017, Version 15.2`. This property can be viewed when you open the IDE and go to `Help > About Microsoft Visual Studio`.

#### A reliable text editor

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - A convenient improvement to the standard notepad editor. This will be used when editing `.conf` files or `.c`. Unlike more complicated text editors ([Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), Notepad++ is much much simpler and would be less confusing for new programmers.

#### The plugin you wish to install

For this tutorial on how to build your HPM plugin, we will use `YourProject` as the name of the plugin. This means that it is contained in a file called `YourProject.c`. Plugins can be downloaded from the [Hercules Board, Plugin Releases](http://herc.ws/board/forum/142-plugin-releases/).

## Are there any tools that I can use to automate this?

In May 2018, User [Kiriez](http://herc.ws/board/profile/8365-kiriez/) introduced the [VS Plugin Creator](http://herc.ws/board/topic/15917-vs-plugin-creator), which automates steps 1 to 13 of the New Method described below. I suggest you try this first to see if it works. Give feedback on the tool (whether it works or not, errors you might encounter) on the thread itself.

If his tool didn't work, try using the [Plugin Automator for Windows](http://herc.ws/board/topic/16480-plugin-automator-for-windows) by User [fourxhackd](http://herc.ws/board/profile/17499-fourxhackd/), which automates steps 1 to 10 of the New Method.

Using the tools will make sure you don't make simple typo-related mistakes, or placing the files in the wrong folder. Doing it manually, as described in the New Method, will show you exactly what the tools do.

## New Method

This new method is recommended. There are two parts to the new method: integrating the plugin into your project's build solution and adding your plugin to the configuration files.

It uses the software [Visual Studio IDE Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and would most likely be the software that you can access and download as of this date.

This method was imported from the Wiki data in 2016, and was updated as of December 2018.

### Integrating the Plugin

#### Step 1

Download the `YourProject.c` from the [Hercules Board, Plugin Releases](http://herc.ws/board/forum/142-plugin-releases/) or build it yourself.

#### Step 2

Copy or move the `YourProject.c` file into your `/src/plugins/` folder.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step1.png)

#### Step 3

Depending on which Visual Studio C project version (`.vcproj`) you are using, navigate to the appropriate folder.

For example, if you are using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (Community 2017), navigate to the directory `\vcproj-15\`. We use 15 because that is the latest build type available (better to use 15 instead of using the older build solutions).
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step2.png)

#### Step 4

Select `plugin-sample.vcxproj`, copy the file, and paste it on the same directory. This will produce a copy of the file with filename `plugin-sample - Copy.vcxproj`.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step3.png)

#### Step 5

Rename `plugin-sample - Copy.vcxproj` into `YourProject.vcxproj`  
While renaming, Highlight the word `YourProject` and Copy it by **Ctrl+C**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step4.png)

#### Step 6

Right click on `YourProject.vcxproj`, select `Edit with Notepad++` or Microsoft Notepad.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step5.png)

#### Step 7

Find the following line:  
`<ProjectName>plugin-sample</ProjectName>`  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step6.png)  
Replace `plugin-sample` with `YourProject`. Make sure that you copy this correctly and not make typos.

To avoid typos, you can use `CTRL+C` to copy the name of the plugin and `CTRL+V` to paste the name of the plugin without making mistakes.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step6_.png)

#### Step 8

Find the following line:  
`<TargetName Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'">sample</TargetName>`  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step7.png)

Replace `sample` to `YourProject`.  
`<TargetName Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'">YourProject</TargetName>`  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step7_.png)

#### Step 9

Find the following line:  
`<ClCompile Include="..\src\plugins\sample.c" />`  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step8.png)

Replace `sample` to `YourProject`.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step8_.png)

#### Step 10

Save the file by pressing `CTRL+S`.

#### Step 11

From your the main folder of your server, open the appropriate Visual Studio solution file `Hercules-N.sln` using your IDE. In this example, we used `Hercules-15.sln` because we are using Microsoft Visual Studio (Community 2017).  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step10.png)

#### Step 12

On the Solution Explorer tab, right click `Hercules-15`, select `Add > Existing Project...`  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step11.png)

#### Step 13

Select `YourProject.vcxproj` in the `\vcproj-15\` folder.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step12.png)

#### Step 14

Right click `Solution 'Hercules-15' and select Build Solution.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnnieRuru/customs/master/screenshots/MSVC_step13.png)

This will now re-build your Hercules server while also integrating your plugin. This patches up the source code as necessary and includes the code into the appropriate `.c` files without you having to go to the individual files.

#### Adding your plugin to the configuration

Finally, we will open the file <code>/conf/plugins.conf</code> and include the name of our new plugin into the list.
  plugins_list: [
  	/* Enable HPMHooking when plugins in use rely on Hooking */
  	//"HPMHooking",
  	//"db2sql",
  	//"sample",
  	//"other",
  	"YourProject"
  ]

## Old Method

{{Quote|text=This guide used Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) 2008 as an IDE. This guide was tested using that IDE as well. It was also tested using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010.|sign=Ind}}

### Instructions

#### Step 1

Go to 'src/plugins/' folder, create a new '.c' file, e.g. 'dance.c' (this name will be used throughout this guide)
[[File:step1.JPG|center|750px]]

#### Step 2

Open dance.c and paste this code
```C
#include "common/hercules.h" // Should always be the first Hercules file included! (if you don't make it first, you won't be able to use interfaces)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "common/HPMi.h"
#include "map/script.h"
#include "map/pc.h"
#include "common/HPMDataCheck.h" // should always be the last file included! (if you don't make it last, it'll intentionally break compile time)

HPExport struct hplugin_info pinfo = {
	"dance",		// Plugin name
	SERVER_TYPE_MAP,// Which server types this plugin works with?
	"0.2",			// Plugin version
	HPM_VERSION,	// HPM Version (don't change, macro is automatically updated)
};

ACMD(dance) {
	if (!message || !*message) {
		clif->message(fd, "usage: @dance 1-9");
		return -1;
	}
	if ( atoi(message) == 1 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 413, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 2 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 414, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 3 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 415, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 4 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 426, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 5 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 458, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 6 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 466, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 7 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 501, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 8 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 540, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else if ( atoi(message) == 9 ) {
		clif->specialeffect(&sd->bl, 550, ALL_CLIENT);
	} else {
		clif->message(fd, "usage: @dance 1-9"); 
	}
	return true;
}

/* Server Startup */
HPExport void plugin_init (void) {
	addAtcommand("dance",dance);
}
```

#### Step 3

Open your MSVC project (e.g. '''Hercules-10.sln'')
