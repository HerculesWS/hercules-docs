# Editing the Wiki

The Hercules wiki could always use help. It is an ever changing repository of useful information related to Hercules, such as configuration, connecting, setting up, Compiling and scripting. However, please follow the below points when trying to edit.

1. Do not create pages or guides for custom content. Base client specific content is OK, as this is the main point behind Hercules. However, leave patchers, custom patches or plugins, setup of custom items or mobs, or control panels out.
2. Be sure you follow all of the applicable [[Style Guide|Style Guides]] for the content you are trying to create. 
3. Be sure you write in proper and complete English. Again, reference the Style Guide for specific examples.
4. Do not engage in Edit wars. 
5. Do not initiate the deletion of a page unless you are a Hercules staff member. If you have a page you are requesting for deletion, please include the relevant [[Template]].
