==Description==
GM commands can be used to perform a wide array of tasks in-game, such as system administration, database queries, player actions, and collecting information regarding a player, party, guild, pet, and/or homunculus. For a full list of atcommands, please see {{git|doc/atcommands.txt}}

==Examples==
===atcommands===
<pre>
@item 909 10
</pre>

===charcommands===
<pre>
#item Ind 909 10
</pre>

==Notes==
While it is common knowledge throughout the [[Ragnarok Online]] community that atcommands use the '''@''' symbol, the symbol used can be changed to any other character by adjusting '''atcommand_symbol''' and '''charcommand_symbol''' in {{git|conf/atcommand.conf}}
