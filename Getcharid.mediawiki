[[Category:Script_Command]]
==Syntax==
* [[getcharid]](<type>{,"<character name>"});
==Description==
This function will return a unique ID number of the invoking character, or, if a 
character name is specified, of that character.

For most purposes other than printing it, a number is better to have than a name 
(people do horrifying things to their character names).

If the character is not in a party or not in a guild, the function will return 0 
if guild or party number is requested. If a name is specified and the character 
is not found, 0 is returned.

If [[getcharid]](0) returns a zero, the script got called not by a character and 
doesn't have an attached [[RID]]. Note that this will cause the map server to
print "player not attached!" error messages, so it is preferred to use
'[[playerattached]]' to check for the character attached to the script.
