==Syntax==
*'''getitemname'''(<item id>);

==Description==
Retrieves the display name for an item given by ID from the 3rd column in the item database. If there is no such item, "null" is returned as name.

==Examples==
 [[mes]] "See? Whenever you find some "+getitemname(512)+", bring it to me.";
Output will be: "See? Whenever you find some Apple, bring it to me."

 mes "See? Whenever you find some "+getitemname(12)+", bring it to me.";
Since there is usually no item with ID 12, so output will be: "See? Whenever you find some null, bring it to me."
