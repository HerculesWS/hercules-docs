= A what? =
A '''hex editor''' (or ''binary file editor'' or ''byte editor'') is a type of computer program that allows a user to manipulate the fundamental binary (0 / 1, zero / one) data that makes up computer files.  Note that computer files can be very small (just a name, with no content) to very large (content spanning multiple hard disks).  A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are put together to form the file. For more details see the [[wikipedia:Hex_editor|related Wikipedia article]].
