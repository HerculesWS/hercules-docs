# Welcome to Hercules

Hercules is an open-source project, revolving around the creation of a robust massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) server package, emulating a Ragnarok Online Server. The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world as well as a tremendous community providing QA and support. Hercules is a continuation of the original Athena project.

Hercules currently runs on most common Operating Systems currently available today. For a full list, please see the [[System Requirements]].
