==Syntax==
*'''isnight'''();

==Description==
These functions determine whether server day or night cycle is currently in effect or not. If the server night is in effect, isnight will return true, otherwise false.

==Examples==
 [[if]](!isnight())
 {
     [[mes]] "I do not work at day, come again tomorrow.";
     [[close]];
 }

 if(isnight())
 {
     mes "I do not work at night, come again tomorrow.";
     close;
 }
These two script fragments achieve the same effect.
