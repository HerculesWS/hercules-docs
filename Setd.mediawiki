[[Category:Script_Command]]
==Syntax==
* [[setd]] "<variable name>",<value>;

==Description==
Works almost identical as [[set]], just that the variable name is identified as a string, 
thus can be constructed dynamically.

This command is equivalent to:
 set [[getd]]("variable name"),<value>;

==Examples==
 set .@mob_id, 1002;
 setd ".prize_" + .@mob_id, 911; // sets the value of .prize_1002 to 911
