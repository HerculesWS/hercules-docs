This article is huge. Wouldn't it be more efficient to create a [[Special: Categories|category]] for the [[Hercules Interface System]], with each large section its own article? Such articles would require the code <code><nowiki>[[Category: Hercules Interface System]]</nowiki></code> added to the footer, but it's simple enough that it can be arranged appropriately. My suggestion is based simply on how cluttered all of this information is on one page. -Via
: Surely. Some interface structures have way too many functions (such as clif) and I thought about doing that, however as basic as it is right now (information-wise) I wasn't quiet sure if that would be worth it. I'd guess the idea is to eventually try to complete with more information regarding each structure which would make having each interface structure in its own category. However, I also though about the possibility of ctrl+f'ing for a specific function and its corresponding interface function for easier referencing. This could/should probabbly be moved to a Interface System Referencing page instead and make the things you suggested in a separate page? As well as limiting the depth of the Contents menu. 
: This is probably the first wiki page I ever write so if there is any better way to deploy it, I am all up for it! :P [[User:Xgear|Xgear]] ([[User talk:Xgear|talk]]) 07:56, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
