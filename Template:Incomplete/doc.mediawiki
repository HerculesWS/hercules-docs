This is the template used to put a banner at the top of an article to identify it as '''incomplete''', i.e. an author signals that he thinks that an article needs more work.

==Usage==
You can get this banner by inserting the following template in your article (usually at the beginning):

 <nowiki>{{incomplete}}</nowiki>

For sections use:

 <nowiki>{{incomplete|type=section}}</nowiki>

This will also insert your article in the [[:Category:Incomplete]].
