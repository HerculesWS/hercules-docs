This template is used for articles or sections, whose content was correct in the past, but is either no longer supported or no longer required and is kept for legacy purposes only.

==Usage==
Include the following at the beginning of an article or a section:
 <nowiki>{{obsolete
|type=... (allows to specify, what was obsoleted, default 'article', optional)
|when=... (specifies, what obsoleted the subject, usually a date or revision)
}}</nowiki>

Template {{Tl|obsolete2}} supports in addition to the above parameters also parameter ''see'' to specify an alternative article (such as replacement of the obsoleted article content).

==Examples==
 <nowiki>{{obsolete|when=April 2010}}</nowiki>
{{obsolete|when=April 2010}}

 <nowiki>{{obsolete
|type=script command
|when=r9788}}</nowiki>
{{obsolete
|type=script command
|when=r9788}}

 <nowiki>{{obsolete2|when=version 3|see=Template:Obsolete2}}</nowiki>
{{obsolete2|when=version 3|see=Template:Obsolete2}}
