This is the template used to put a banner at the top of an article to identify it as '''outdated''', i.e. an author signals that he thinks that an article needs to be updated to reflect recent changes.

== Usage ==
You can get this banner by inserting the following template in your article (usually at the beginning):

 <nowiki>{{outdated}}</nowiki>

If only a section should be marked incomplete, use following at the beginning of the section:

 <nowiki>{{outdated|type=section}}</nowiki>

This will also insert your article in the [[:Category:Articles in need of updating]].
