An '''account id''' uniquely identifies a player (gender Female(F) or Male (M)) or server account (gender S) not only inside the database, but also in inter-server communication and in associations of data with an account, such as [[Variables|account variables]]. Account ID is also used to save the character data, and is uniqu. In-game it is mostly used as a [[GID|game id]]. It should not be confused with [[CID|character id]] which identifies a character.
