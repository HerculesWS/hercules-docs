== Syntax ==
* [[addmonsterdrop]] (<mob id or name>, <item id>, <rate>);
== Description ==
<p>This command will temporarily add a drop to an existing monster. If the<br>
monster already drops the specified item, its drop rate will be updated to the<br>
given value.</p>

<p>Both the monster and the item must be valid.  Acceptable values for the drop<br>
rate are in the range [1:10000].</p>

<p>Return value will be 1 in case of success (the item was added or its drop rate<br>
was updated), and 0 otherwise (there were no free item drop slots).</p>
== Example ==
 	// Add Poring Doll (741) to the Poring's (1002) drops, with 1% (100) rate
 	addmonsterdrop(1002, 741, 100);
