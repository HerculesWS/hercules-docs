== Syntax ==
* [[agitstart]];
* [[agitend]];

== Description ==
These two commands will start and end the [[War of Emperium]].

This is a bit more complex than it sounds, since the commands themselves won't actually do anything interesting, except causing all [[OnAgitStart]] and [[OnAgitEnd]] events to run everywhere. They are used as simple triggers to run a lot of complex scripts in {{git|npc/guild}}, which are responsible for the actual starting and ending of the guild siege. [[Agitstart]] and [[agitend]] are usually triggered by clock with an [[OnClock]]<time> labels.

== Example ==
 [[OnAgitInit]]:
 	[[if]] ([[gettime]](3)>=19 && [[gettime]](3)<21) {
 		[[agitstart]];
 	}
 	[[end]];
 [[OnClock]]1900:
 	[[agitstart]];
 	[[end]];
 [[OnClock]]2100:
 	[[agitend]];
 	[[end]];

A basic WoE controller script, which resumes the siege, even when the server is started during the WoE period.
