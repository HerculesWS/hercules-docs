==Syntax==
* [[bg_monster]](<BG Team ID>,"<mapname>",<x>,<y>,"<name>",<mob id>{,"<event>"});

==Description==
This command is part of the Battleground System and works nearly the same as '[[monster]]', but the spawned monster will fight for the selected BG team and '[[bg_monster]]' returns the GID of the spawned monster. The GID can be useful for commands like '[[bg_monster_set_team]]'.
