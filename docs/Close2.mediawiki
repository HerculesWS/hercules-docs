==Syntax==
*'''close2''';

==Description==
This command will create a 'close' button in the message window for the invoking character. This is one of the ways to end a speech from an [[NPC]]. Once the button is clicked, the message box will disappear, but unlike [[close]] the script execution will continue. So after a '''close2''' command an [[end]] command must follow to terminate the script. If no window is currently on screen, the [[RID|invoking character]] will get stuck in the NPC.

==Examples==
 [[mes]] "[Woman]";
 mes "I am finished talking to you, click the close button.";
 '''close2''';
 [[dispbottom]] "This will be shown at the characters chat window.";
 [[end]];

 mes "Thank you for using";
 mes "the Kafra Services.";
 '''close2''';
 [[cutin]] "", 255;
 end;
Probably the most common usage of this command. Removing a previously set cutin, after the NPC dialog is closed.
