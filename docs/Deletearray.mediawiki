==Syntax==
*'''deletearray''' <array>, <amount of elements to delete>;

==Description==
This command deletes a range of values within given array and shifts remaining values to fill the deletion gap.

'''Important:''' Currently (r14395) the command uses [[getarraysize]] internally, which leads to unpredictable results with arrays, that contain empty elements. It is recommended to use a combination of [[copyarray]] and [[cleararray]] instead.

==Examples==
 '''deletearray''' @array, 10;
Deletes the first 10 elements of the array and shifts all other values by one to the left.

 [[copyarray]] @array[0], @array[10], 90;
 [[cleararray]] @array[90], 0, 10;
Assuming ''@array'' has 100 elements, this achieves the same effect as the example above, but works properly even if ''@array'' has empty element(s).
