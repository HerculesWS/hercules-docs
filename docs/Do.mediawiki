== Syntax ==
* [[do]] { <statement>; } [[while]] (<condition>);

== Description ==
The '[[do]]...[[while]]' is the only post-test loop structure available in this 
script language. With a post-test, the statements are executed once before 
the condition is tested. When the condition is true, the statement(s) are 
repeated. When the condition is false, control is transferred to the 
statement following the '[[do]]...[[while]]' loop expression.


<pre>do {
	Code to execute(1)
} while (expression(2));</pre>

<pre>Example 1: sentinel-controlled loop
	mes "This menu will keep appearing until you pick Cancel";
	do {
		set .@menu, select("One:Two:Three:Cancel");
	} while (.@menu != 4);
</pre>

<pre>Example 2: counter-controlled loop
	mes "This will countdown from 10 to 1.";
	set .@i, 10;
	do {
		mes .@i;
		set .@i, .@i - 1;
	} while (.@i > 0);
</pre>
