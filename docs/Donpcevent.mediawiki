==Syntax==
*[[donpcevent]] "<NPC object name>::<event label>";

==Description==
This command invokes the event label code within an another [[NPC]] or NPCs. If ''event label'' has the form "NpcName::OnLabel", then only given NPC's event label will be invoked (much like [[goto]] into another NPC). If the form is "::OnLabel" (''NpcName'' ommited), the event code of all NPCs with given label will be invoked, one after another. In both cases the invoked script will run without an attached [[RID]], whether or not the invoking script was attached to a player. The event label name is required to start with ''On''.

This command can be used to make other NPCs act, as if they were responding to the invoking NPC's actions, such as using an [[emotion]] or [[npctalk|talking]].

==Examples==
 prontera,150,150,3	script	NPC	53,{
     [[mes]] "Hey NPC2 copies what I do.";
     [[close2]];
     [[set]] .@emote, [[rand]](1,30);
     donpcevent "NPC2::OnEmote";
 OnEmote:
     [[emotion]] .@emote;
     [[end]];
 }
 
 prontera,152,150,5	script	NPC2	53,{
     mes "Hey NPC copies what I do.";
     close2;
     set .@emote, rand(1,30);
     donpcevent "NPC::OnEmote";
 OnEmote:
     emotion .@emote;
     end;
 }
Whichever of the both NPCs is talked to, both will show a random emotion at the same time.

Command returns 1 or 0 on success and failure. A debug message also shows on the console when no events are triggered.
