== Syntax ==
* [[getitembound2]] <item id>,<amount>,<identify>,<refine>,<attribute>,<card1>,<card2>,<card3>,<card4>,<bound type>;
* [[getitembound2]] "<item name>",<amount>,<identify>,<refine>,<attribute>,<card1>,<card2>,<card3>,<card4>,<bound type>;

== Description ==
This command behaves identically to [[getitem2]], but the items created will be
bound to the target character as specified by the bound type. All items created
in this manner cannot be dropped, sold, vended, auctioned, or mailed, and in
some cases cannot be traded or stored.

For a list of bound types see [[getitembound]].

Default is 0 if not defined.
== Example ==
    getitembound2 1602,1,1,2,0,4004,4004,4004,4004,1; // The person will receive 1 Account bounded "Rod with 4 Drops card" on it.
