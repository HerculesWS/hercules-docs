==Syntax==
*'''getvariableofnpc'''(<variable>, <"npc name">);

==Description==
This function retrieves a variable reference to a [[Variables#NPC_Variables|permanent NPC variable]] in an another NPC script. Note, that the return value behaves like a variable, not like a value, which means, the return value of this function can be used in other script commands, which expect a variable as parameter.

==Examples==
 [[mes]] "The current name of my co-worker is "+getvariableofnpc(.npcname$, "Site Co-Worker");
Prints the value of the variable ''.npcname$'' as if it was used inside the NPC "Site Co-Worker".

 mes "Let's give him an another name...";
 [[set]] getvariableofnpc(.npcname$, "Site Co-Worker"), "Sleeping Tom";
Sets the variable ''.npcname$'' of the NPC "Site Co-Worker" to "Sleeping Tom".

 set .mynpcnamecopy$, getvariableofnpc(.npcname$, "Site Co-Worker");
 set .mynpcnamecopy$, "Sleeping Tom";
Will change the variable ''.mynpcnamecopy$'' to "Sleeping Tom", but keep the variable ''.npcname$'' of NPC "Site Co-Worker" unaffected, because the first call to set copies the value of ''.npcname$'' to ''.mynpcnamecopy$'', rather than the reference.
