== Syntax ==
* [[goto]] <label>;

== Description ==
This command will make the script execution jump to the specified label. It is often used by beginners in conjunction with [[if]], before they get accustomed to other conditional statements, such as [[for]] or [[switch]]. While advanced scripters typically discourage using [[goto]], it can come handy when requiring to leave a complex nested loop without having to use flags or even more complicated code.

== Examples ==
 [[if]] ([[checkriding]]()) [[goto]] L_riding;
 	[[mes]] "Yay, you're not riding a Peco.";
 	[[close]];
 
 L_riding:
 	[[mes]] "Please dismount your Peco first.";
 	[[close]];
