==Syntax==
*'''itemheal''' <hp>, <sp>;

==Description==
This command heals given absolute amounts of HP and/or SP on the invoking character. Unlike [[heal]], this command is intended for use in item scripts. It applies potion-related bonuses, such as alchemist ranking, cards and status changes. When used inside an NPC script, certain bonuses are omitted.

==Examples==
 itemheal [[rand]](100,150),0;
This heals between 100 and 150 HP and no SP.

==See Also==
* [[heal]]
* [[percentheal]]
