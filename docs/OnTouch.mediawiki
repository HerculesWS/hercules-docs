=Description=
Defines an area that when walked into will trigger one of two event labels. If it is a Player, trigger OnTouch: label. If it is a monster, trigger OnTouchNPC: label.
The OnUnTouch: label works opposite way. This label trigger when a player leave the area.
==Calculating spawned area==
[[File:Ontouch.jpg|thumbnail|A 7*7 area spawned by X:3 Y:3]]
These triggers will define an area, centered on the NPC and spanning <i>triggerX</i> cells in every direction across X coordinate axis and <i>triggerY</i> cells in every direction across Y coordinate axis. Thus each one will have N*2 cells, where N is <i>triggerX</i> or <i>triggerY</i>, plus the one that the NPC is.<br>
Unlike in arithmetics X and Y will also be taken into account when calculating the area that will trigger the NPC. There are four quadrants, each with <i>triggerX</i>*<i>triggerY</i> cells plus both axes.<br>
<br><u>Note that each coordinate is a <b>cell</b> and does not represent map coordinates!</u><br>
 4*(x*y) + 2*x + 2*y + 1
A simple way to measure the area of any polygon that will be covered by OnTouch is <u>(<i>triggerX</i>*2+1)*(<i>triggerY</i>*2+1)</u>
<br>
'''Trick''': Using "end;" at the beginning of the script stops players from executing the script by clicking on the NPC, so they can only execute it if they walk into the specified area.
<br>
==Event labels==
Two event labels are defined and each one handles one of two block types BL_PC or BL_MOB <i>id est</i> a player or a mob.
<br>
 OnTouch:
Handles player types (BL_PC)
 OnTouchNPC:
Handles mob types (BL_MOB)<br>
If no trigger label is defined the code will execute from the beginning of the script, the same way that it would if someone clicked on the NPC.
==Example==
 prontera,147,153,3	script	Mary	71,3,3,{
 	end;
 
 OnTouch:
 	mes "[Mary]";
 	mes "Have you seen my lamb?";
 	close;
 OnTouchNPC: // NO ONE IS ATTACHED!
 	announce "A mob passed here",bc_blue|bc_all;
 	end;
 }
This script will spawn 3 cells in each direction plus a cell in the center.
 4*<u>3</u>*<u>3</u>+2*<u>3</u>+2*<u>3</u>+1 = 49
Or
 (<u>3</u>*2+1) * (<u>3</u>*2+1) =
 7*7 = 49
