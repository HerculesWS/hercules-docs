==Syntax==
*'''setwall''' "<map name>",<x>,<y>,<size>,<dir>,<shootable>,"<wallname>";
*'''delwall''' "<wallname>";

==Description==
Creates an invisible wall, an array of "setcell" starting from x,y and doing a
line of the given size in the given direction. The difference with setcell is
this one updates the client part too, to avoid the glitch problem. Directions are the 
same as NPC sprite facing directions: 0=north, 1=northwest, 2=west, etc.

==Examples==
 -	script	setwall	-1,{
 	[[end]];
 [[OnInit]]:
 	setwall "prontera",64,102,4,2,0,"PrtWall";
 }
