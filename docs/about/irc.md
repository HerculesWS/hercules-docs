# IRC

[IRC](#) stands for [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). Basically, it's
chatroom server and client software in general. In [IRC](#), you have servers and channels. Servers hold
the channels, and are hosted on dedicated machines. The channels are the actual chatrooms. [IRC](#) allows
you to chat with people in real-time around the world.

## Connecting to IRC

The official [Hercules](./index.md) channel room can be found [here](irc://irc.rizon.net/Hercules).  
Web-based IRC chat is available too: <https://herc.ws/board/page/irc.html>

To actually connect to [IRC](#), if you do not already have an [IRC
client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) and do not wish to run the java chat, you're
going to need an IRC client. There are many different IRC clients, and none are really the 'best'. Opinions vary on
which are better. The most commonly used IRC client on [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) is
[mIRC](http://www.mirc.com). The most commonly used client on \*nix is a tossup between [BitchX](http://www.bitchx.org)
and [XChat](http://www.xchat.org). Note that XChat is pay-to-use on [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows),
but not on \*nix.

For those not looking to go in-depth into manuals to figure out how to connect, you can actually be up and running by
simply installing mIRC, and then typing the following two commands into the mIRC command line on the status window:

```
/nick NickYouWantHere
/server irc.rizon.net -j #Hercules
```

And you'll be connected.
