# IRC

[[IRC]] stands for [[wikipedia:Internet_Relay_Chat|Internet Relay Chat]]. Basically, it's chatroom server and client software in general. In [[IRC]], you have servers and channels. Servers hold the channels, and are hosted on dedicated machines. The channels are the actual chatrooms. [[IRC]] allows you to chat with people in real-time around the world. 

== Connecting to IRC ==
The official [[Hercules]] channel room can be found [irc://irc.rizon.net/Hercules here]. <br />
Web-based IRC chat is available too: http://herc.ws/board/page/irc.html

To actually connect to [[IRC]], if you do not already have an [[wikipedia:Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients|IRC client]] and do not wish to run the java chat, you're going to need an IRC client. There are many different IRC clients, and none are really the 'best'. Opinions vary on which are better. The most commonly used IRC client on [[wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows|Microsoft Windows]] is [http://www.mirc.com mIRC]. The most commonly used client on *nix is a tossup between [http://www.bitchx.org BitchX] and [http://www.xchat.org XChat]. Note that XChat is pay-to-use on [[wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows|Windows]], but not on *nix. 

For those not looking to go in-depth into manuals to figure out how to connect, you can actually be up and running by simply installing mIRC, and then typing the following two commands into the mIRC command line on the status window:
  /nick NickYouWantHere
  /server irc.rizon.net -j #Hercules 

And you'll be connected.
