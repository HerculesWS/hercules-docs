An **account id** uniquely identifies a player (gender Female(F) or Male (M)) or server account (gender S) not only
inside the database, but also in inter-server communication and in associations of data with an account, such as
[account variables](../scripting/variables.md). Account ID is also used to save the character data, and is uniqu. In-game it
is mostly used as a [game id](gid). It should not be confused with [character id](cid) which
identifies a character.
