{{OtherUse|game object id in general|player game id|AID}}
The '''GID''' stands for game id or game object id. It uniquely identifies each and every dynamic object ([[NPC]], [[mob|monster]], player, item, skill unit) inside the game. For the players a GID is their [[AID|account id]], for all other objects it is a server-generated id, that changes each time the object is created.

You can view the id in-game by right-clicking on a object, when your account has enabled game master menu.
