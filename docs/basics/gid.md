# Game ID (GID)

The **GID** stands for game id or game object id.

It uniquely identifies each and every dynamic object ([NPC](./npc.md), [monster](../overview/source/mob/index.md),
player, item, skill unit) inside the game.

For the players a GID is their [account id (AID)](./aid.md), for all other objects it is a server-generated id, that changes each time the object
is created.

You can view the id in-game by right-clicking on a object, when your account has enabled game master menu.
