**Kafra Corporation** is a group of Ragnarok Online
[NPCs](NPC "wikilink"), which is generally responsible for setting save points, giving access to player's item storage,
providing teleport services and renting merchant class carts. Later episodes introduced two further groups for the same
services; namely Cool Event Corporation (western continent) and Cat Hand Services (new world).
