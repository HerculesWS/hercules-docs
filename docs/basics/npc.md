![[Kafra](Kafra "wikilink") NPC](assets/Kafra2.gif "Kafra NPC")

[NPC](./npc.md) stands for Non-Player (or playable)
Character. An NPC is any person or "living" creature in a game not controlled by a player. For example, any units in any
game that would give you a quest, tell you what to do, or just stand there while you speak to them is considered an NPC.

In [Ragnarok Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online), NPCs are a pretty big part of the game. The
[Hercules](../about/index.md) scripting language is used to create NPCs. You can find many premade NPCs on the
[Hercules Boards](https://herc.ws/board/). Any character you speak to in Ragnarok Online not controlled by a player is
an NPC. From warpers, over healers and quest guides, to item sellers. Generally, in Ragnarok Online, a monster is
referred to as a [mob](../overview/source/mob/index.md), and not an NPC, however they are technically considered NPCs as well.
