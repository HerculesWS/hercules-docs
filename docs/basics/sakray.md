# Sakray

**Sakray** is what official [Ragnarok Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online) test servers are usually referred to. They are
used to test new content and features, before they get installed on the normal servers. When the name "Sakray" is used
alone, it typically refers to the kRO Sakray server. Sakray servers are always accessible via a separate client, which
is available through a separate download.

## History

### Renewal

Gravity discontinued the original Sakray development after June 17, 2009, where the last Sakray client was released, and
replaced it with Sakray Renewal, which is mostly referred to as "Renewal" or "RE".

On kRO, on July 28th Gravity set up a new test server for their Ragnarok Renewal Project. The Renewal is a full scale
re-balancing of Ragnarok. The plan is to make RO more accessible to users, and more in line with modern day MMORPG's. In
addition, the new mechanics are intended so that they can easily add and improve on current game content (such as 3rd
jobs) without destroying game balance.

The intention for renewing Ragnarok Online, was partially the decreasing interest in the game, due to it's age and lack
of features present in latest MMORPG, such as tabbed chat or safe skill point distribution, which were part of the first
round of renewal, the interface renewal. Further changes include an overhaul in the stat, damage and experience
calculation.

few people prefer using kRO (live server) clients or clients from different service providers.
