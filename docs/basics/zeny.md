# Zeny

Zeny is the in-game currency used in [Ragnarok Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online), which can be used
for buying and selling items from and to [NPC](./npc.md) shops and other players.

## Limitation

The technical limit is for both the client and server up to 2,147,483,647 Zeny, which is typically capped at
1,000,000,000. The cap can be changed inside
[`src/common/mmo.h`](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/src/common/mmo.h) by adjusting the macro
`MAX_ZENY` to a desired value below the technical limit. The source must be recompiled after this change. If a value is
specified which surpasses the technical limit, the server will not compile.

## Penalty

Along with EXP death penalties, a Zeny penalty may be set in
[`conf/battle/exp.conf`](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/conf/battle/exp.conf) which reduced the
amount of Zeny the player holds upon death:

```
// When a player dies (to another player), how much zeny should we penalize them with?
// NOTE: It is a percentage of their zeny, so 100 = 1%
zeny_penalty: 0
```

[Mapflags](../scripting/mapflag.md) can be set on certain maps to disable the zeny penalty in
[`npc/mapflag/nopenalty.txt`](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/npc/mapflag/nopenalty.txt)

## Vending

The amount of Zeny that can be set to an item when vending is soft-limited to 1,000,000,000 and can be overridden by the
setting `vending_max_value` in
[`conf/map/battle/items.conf`](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/conf/map/battle/items.conf) and
[hexing](../client/hexing.md) the client to correct the client-side warnings.

If the seller obtains more Zeny through vending than `MAX_ZENY` the surplus Zeny is discarded. To avoid this, the
setting `vending_over_max` in
[`conf/map/battle/items.conf`](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/conf/map/battle/items.conf) can be set to
`false`, which causes the deal to fail if it would result in more Zeny than the seller is able to hold.

## Scripting

The name `Zeny` is recognized by the script engine as a [parameter constant](../scripting/parameter-constant.md), which
affects the amount of Zeny of the [currently attached](./rid.md#usage) player. It can be both read and written.

```C
Zeny += 120; // gives the player 120z
mesf("Your current balance is %dz.", Zeny);
Zeny = 0; // takes all Zeny from the player
```
