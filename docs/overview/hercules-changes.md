Since May 30th on the [https://herc.ws/board/topic/928-memory-slasher-may-30-patch/|Memory Slasher Patch]
==== Functionality/Feature ====
* map server was made capable of creating instances of any maps regardless of client-side edits, e.g. one can clone prontera and call it "mymapname"
* instances were modified to be employed in 4 distinct ways:
** by nobody (server type instance, to be used with special map names)
** by a sole character
** by a party
** by by a guild
==== Script Command Changes ====
* [[instance_create]] 2nd param was renamed to owner_id, (was party_id) , and it got a 3rd optional param that defines what kind of owner id it is (when not provided, assumes party_id, for backwards compatibility), available options are (IOT_ stands for INSTANCE OWNER TYPE) IOT_NONE (0), IOT_CHAR (1), IOT_PARTY (2) and IOT_GUILD (3).
* [[instance_destroy]] no longer autodetects instance id from party id
* [[instance_attachmap]] was given a 4th, optional, param, "<new map name>", it allows a entirely new map name to be specified for the instance (without the need of client-side edits). this option can be best employed when used on a instance of <owner_type> IOT_NONE
* [[instance_detachmap]] no longer autodetects instance id from party id
* [[instance_id]] no longer supports any param
* [[instance_set_timeout]] no longer autodetects instance id from party id
* [[instance_announce]] no longer autodetects instance id from party id, and to tell it to autodetect from the attached script you must set instance_id param as -1 as opposed to 0
* [[instance_npcname]] no longer autodetects instance id from party id
* [[has_instance]] no longer autodetects instance from party, however it now checks if attached player possesses a instance with same map as [[has_instance]](<param>) checks for
* [[instance_warpall]] no longer autodetects instance from party
==== Other Changes ====
* instance IDs (valid ones) are now always >= 0 as opposed to > 0
