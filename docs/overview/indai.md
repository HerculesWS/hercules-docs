IndAI is a feature employed by [Hercules Stress Test
Server](https://herc.ws/board/topic/342-introducing-hercules-stress-test-server/).

## Preamble

1.  **What is this?** to make it short, its the ability for the game server to create and control player-looking units
2.  **Why the pretentious name?** Inds bad at naming stuff.

## Capabilities

- IndAI units use normal player-character data, making them fit (be compatible) perfectly into all
  player-character-features.
- IndAI units are capable of farming, doing pvp, doing woe, doing battlegrounds.

## Availability

We judged this feature to be potentially dangerous to the private server community if made public, so we'll be keeping
it private to be used solely by the [Hercules Stress Test
Server](https://herc.ws/board/topic/342-introducing-hercules-stress-test-server/)
