# `bonus3()`

!!! warning
	This page may contain outdated information, incompatible with the current version of Hercules and its coding standards.

## Syntax

```c
bonus3(<bonus type>, <val1>, <val2>, <val3>);
```

## Description

These commands are meant to be used in item scripts. They will probably work 
outside item scripts, but the bonus will not persist for long. They, as 
expected, refer only to an invoking character.

## Parameters

### Bonus Type

You can find the full list of possible bonuses types and which values to use for each kind in [doc/item_bonus.txt](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/blob/stable/doc/item_bonus.txt).
