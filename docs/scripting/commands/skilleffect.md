== Description ==
This command displays visual and aural effects of given skill on [[RID|currently attached character]]. The number parameter is for skill whose visual effect involves displaying of a number (healing or damaging). Note, that this command will not actually use the skill, it is intended for scripts, which simulate skill usage by the [[NPC]], such as buffs, by setting appropriate status and displaying the skill's effect.

== Examples ==
 [[mes]] "Be blessed!";
 // Heal of 2000 HP
 [[heal]] 2000,0;
 [[skilleffect]] 28,2000;
 
 // Blessing Level 10
 [[sc_start]] 10,240000,10;
 [[skilleffect]] 34,0;
 
 // Increase AGI Level 5
 [[sc_start]] 12,140000,5;
 [[skilleffect]] 29,0;

This will heal the character with 2000 HP, buff it with Blessing Lv 10 and Increase AGI Lv 5, and display appropriate effects.
