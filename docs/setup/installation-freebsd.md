# Installation (FreeBSD)

This article is aimed at installing and getting [[Hercules]] to run successfully on a machine running [[wikipedia:FreeBSD|FreeBSD]] 9.1-RELEASE. It is assumed that FreeBSD was installed with the ports collection and enabled Linux Threading on install. This guide will NOT teach you how to network FreeBSD, install FreeBSD or configure any additional system settings (besides the ones needed to run Hercules and its dependencies).

=Before we Start=
We will primarily working from the /home/user directory. Your primary user will need to be in the 'wheel' group and be able to su into root. Remember that I will include either $ or #, depending on who you should be. $ indicates you should be your primary user, and # indicates you should be root.

=Required software=
We are going to use FreeBSD's ports collection to download, install and use most of these programs. It is assumed you already installed the ports collection, if you have not, I suggest you do that now.

==Ports Collection==
The Ports Collection is a set of files used to compile and install applications on FreeBSD. While this is not a guide for FreeBSD, its recommended to obtain the same as given below:
<code><pre>
# portsnap fetch
Download a compressed snapshot of the Ports Collection into /var/db/portsnap.

# portsnap extract
When running Portsnap for the first time, extract the snapshot into /usr/ports
</pre></code>


==wget==
wget is a download manager available on FreeBSD and can be your bread and butter while working on FreeBSD.
<code><pre># whereis wget
wget: /usr/ports/www/wget
# cd /usr/ports/www/wget && make && make install
# make clean
# rehash</pre></code>

==gmake==
gmake, or GNUMake, is the GCC compiler used for FreeBSD. 
<code><pre>
# whereis gmake
gmake: /usr/ports/devel/gmake
# cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake && make && make install
# make clean
# rehash
</pre></code>

==unrar==
unrar is a tool to unrar .rar's in BSD. 
<code><pre>
# whereis unrar
unrar: /usr/ports/archivers/unrar
$ cd /usr/ports/archivers/unrar
$ make clean
$ make install
$ rehash
</pre></code>

==GCC==
GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection and front ends for C, C++ and other languages.
This may not be available on the system but it can be obtained as below:
<code><pre># wget http://www.netgull.com/gnu/gcc/gcc-###.tar.gz (Where ## is the version number. visit the mirror to find out)
# tar -xvf gcc-###.tar.gz
# cd gcc*
# make && make install
# make clean
# rehash</pre></code>

==gdb== 
GDB is handy tool to have on a development machine, as it can take backtraces of crashes and help you find what went wrong.
It is probable that this is already available on your FreeBSD, but if it's not, here's how you can install it:
<code><pre># wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-###.tar.gz (again, where ### is the version number, check out the mirror)
# tar -xvf gdb-###.tar.gz
# cd gdb*
# make && make install
# make clean 
# rehash</pre></code>

==git==
[[Git]] is the versioning system used for Hercules and how we will get our copy of Hercules. 
<code><pre># whereis git
git: /usr/ports/devel/git
# cd /usr/ports/devel/git && make && make install
# make clean
# rehash
</pre></code>

Now, let's go ahead and download Hercules. We'll use git for this. 

<pre>
$ su root
# adduser //create a Hercules user
# exit
$ su hercules
$ cd /home/hercules
$ git clone https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules.git Hercules
$</pre>

Now, we can populate the tables with the .sql files in Hercules. Navigate to your /sql-files/ folder in the Hercules files you just checked out.

<pre>
$ cd /home/hercules/trunk/sql-files
$ mysql -uuser -ppassword myr-odb < main.sql
$ mysql -uuser -ppassword myro-db < logs.sql
</pre>

Now, you'll want to follow the steps in the [[:Category:Configuration]] and [[Connecting]] pages to get your Hercules configured. Once you've made all your source changes, you can compile Hercules. While you're in the root of your Hercules folder, issue the following commands to compile your server:

<pre>
$ ./configure
$ gmake clean
$ gmake sql
$ rehash
</pre>

'''Important Note:''' If you are using a 32 bit FreeBSD you have to use
<pre>
chmod 777 configure
$ ./configure --disable-64bit
</pre>
instead

''NOTE:'' You should '''NEVER''' run Hercules as the root user!. Always setup a new user and this cannot be stressed enough on!
This will also prevent your from having difficulties with file permissions.

And to start your servers, you can simply use the following command:

<pre>
$ ./athena-start <command> (start | stop | restart | status)
</pre>

And that's it! You now have Hercules running on your FreeBSD machine!
